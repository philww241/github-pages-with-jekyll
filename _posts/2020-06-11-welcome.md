title: "Definition and origins of Frictionless Enterprise"

Here is a definition of Frictionless Enterprise taken from an article Phil wrote in May 2016: 

> Frictionless enterprise is a business architecture that optimizes the use of connected digital technologies to strip out cost, delay and opacity when harnessing resources and delivering outcomes. Simply put, it erases the barriers that get in the way of getting things done.

But there's a lot more to the concept. The following articles outline various aspects, starting with the article from which the above definition is taken, and working back all the way to the first public use of the term in 2011:

In that 2011 article, Phil says Frictionless Enterprise is "the title of a book I'm working on to publish next year." That didn't happen, even though the goal remains to collect all of the material together into a book at some future point. In the meantime, this site collects together the various published fragments into a semi-organized preview.
